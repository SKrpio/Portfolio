                 <section id="bio"> <p>My recent journey from the finance world to the tech industry is a testament to my love for growth and continuous learning. In my current role, I strive to balance my analytical skills and attention to detail to effectively resolve data issues. Drawing from my background in finance, I possess a unique insight into how these issues can disrupt important financial operations. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, I actively contribute to improving client experiences, streamlining processes, and mitigating risks. Implementing quick and effective solutions is something I take great pride in.
                        Shortly after assuming my current role, my previous interest in coding resurfaced. Recognizing the opportunity it presented, I eagerly applied for SheCodes, which has provided me with a remarkable platform to explore a wide range of technical skills and expand my knowledge.
                        During my spare time, I find joy in indulging my passion for ballet, immersing myself in captivating books, and engaging in the art of preserving butterflies.
